I am a 4th year Ph.D. studuent in statistics at Harvard University. My research interests include high-dimensional statistics and Bayesian methodology. I am especially interested in developing new methodologies to provide more efficient and stable estimation for investigating the dependence structure in high-dimensional data, which include dimension reduction and variable selection. 
Meanwhile, I enjoy establishing theorectical guarantees for these new methods with probabilistic tools such as random matrices theories and information theores.
