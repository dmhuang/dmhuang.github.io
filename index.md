I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in statistics at Harvard University, coadvised by Samuel Kou and Lucas Janson. My research interests include high-dimensional statistics and Bayesian inference. 

I am especially interested in developing new methods for  efficient and stable statistical analyses of the dependence structure in high-dimensional data, and establishing the theoretical guarantees as well as optimialities for these new methods. 
Specifically, I have been worked on dimension reduction using inverse regression and variable selection using Model-X knockoffs.
