## Dongming Huang

Welcome!

I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in statistics at Harvard University, coadvised by Samuel Kou and Lucas Janson. My research interests include high-dimensional statistics and Bayesian inference. 

I am especially interested in developing new methods for efficient and stable statistical analyses of the dependence structures in high-dimensional data, and establishing the theoretical guarantees for these new methods. Specifically, I have been worked on dimension reduction using inverse regression and variable selection using Model-X knockoffs.

Before coming to Harvard, I received a B.S. in probability from Peking University in China.
